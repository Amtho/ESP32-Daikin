# PCB designs

The `Faikin` director has the current working design.

Other directories such as `Faikin2` or `Faikin3` are work in progress and may not be tested yet. They will replace `Faikin` once tested.

The `PCBCase` is a tool for making 3D cases from the PCBs files, these are usually kept up to date as an `.stl` file in the directory. The `Makefile` simply runs this tool.
