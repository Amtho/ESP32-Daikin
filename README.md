# ESP32-Daikin

## work in progress

This is code to run on an ESP32 module and connect to a Daikin aircon unit in place of a BRP069C41 module.

* KiCad PCB designs included.
* Documentation of reverse engineered protocol include

Basically, Daikin have gone all cloudy with the latest WiFi controllers. This module is designed to provide an alternative.

This plan is MQTT linked, one day maybe even Matter linked, and maybe support the old style Daikin WiFi comments as well, we'll see.
